# Visits module

This module takes care of desk bookings.

## Available Widgets

This module provides functionality for desk booking but does not have specific desk booking widgets, as they are part of the booking flow, which start when user uses [Office vists module](./office-visits.md).

### Who is in Office

To enable - add `["visits", "WhoIsInOffice", { "offices": ["berlin", "lisbon", "london"] }]` in the [application.json](../framework/configuration/application.md) configuration.
