Users can search using:

- Names: Search by first name, last name, or both.

- Tags: Users can add personalized tags to their profiles, enabling searches based on specific interests, skills, or attributes.

- Other Fields: The search functionality extends to other fields filled in by users on their profiles, such as their social media handles.

A great example is searching for people using their github handles.
