# Announcement module

The Announcement Module is designed to broadcast important updates, notifications, and reminders to all users.
Announcements are displayed at the top of the user interface, ensuring maximum visibility to all users upon logging in to the platform.

Each announcement is assigned an expiration date, ensuring that outdated information is automatically removed from the display.

## Create

Announcements are managed through the administration panel accessible to authorized personnel.

Admins can create, edit, and delete announcements as needed, providing them with full control over the content displayed to users. Admins can choose which users see which announcements using the in-built permissions system.

Announcements support markdown text.

Additionally, admins can set expiration dates for announcements, defining the duration of their visibility on the platform.
