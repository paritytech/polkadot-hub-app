# Modules

All user-facing widgets of the application are (and should be) located in its own modules, which can depend on other modules, as well as use integrations to communicate with external services. Each module manages its own router and can implement all the necessary pages, widgets, webhooks for itself. Integrations are used to store credentials for different external services (e.g., sending email), so that you don't have to reconfigure this at each module level.
